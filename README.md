🌸 Iris Species Classification
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning classification model using the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements.

The model classifies flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

📊 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers with the following features:
